# Credit Realibility for Credit Card Issuance

In the "Credit Reliability for Credit Card Issuance" project as part of the Machine Learning course, I worked on developing a predictive model to assess the creditworthiness of individuals applying for credit cards. The project aimed to enhance the accuracy of credit risk evaluation, thereby optimizing the credit approval process and minimizing potential financial losses.
